            <b>Cloud computing</b> services can focus on infrastructure, web development or a cloud-based app. These are often regarded as a stack; all are on-demand, pay-as-you-go. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) gives you management of the whole deal: servers, web development tools, applications. Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers a complete web development environment, without the worry of the hardware that runs it. Finally, Software as a Service (SaaS) allows access to cloud-based apps, usually through a web browser interface. SaaS is the top of the stack. Cloud computing has been around since 2000. Yet it’s only in the last 10 years that major players like IBM, Amazon, and Google have offered commercially viable, high-capacity networks.</p><br>

          Well, much like with any utility -a business benefits from economy of scale, which means cheap computing power. Because a cloud provider’s hardware and software are shared, there’s no need for the initial costly capital investment. And it goes much further than that. Businesses save on the electricity required 24/7 to power and cool that computing infrastructure. In effect, energy costs are shared.
It gets better. Cloud providers have vast resources of computing power at their fingertips. They can allocate these whenever required with just a few mouse clicks. Cloud providers source on a global scale, so they can deliver the precise bandwidth, storage and power business needs when it needs it.
The cloud allows you and multiple users to access your data from any location. Smartphone, laptop, desktop, wherever you are, you can access the data you need at any time.
With cloud computing a business processes its data more efficiently, increasing productivity. Maintenance is much cheaper, often free, so reliability is rarely a worry. Cloud computing allows CEOs to focus on running their business.<br>

          <b>Autonomic computing (AC)</b> is an approach to address the complexity and evolution problems in software systems. It is a self-managing computing model named after, and patterned on, the human body's autonomic nervous system. An autonomic computing system would control the functioning of computer applications and systems without input from the user, in the same way, that the autonomic nervous system regulates body systems without conscious input from the individual. The goal of autonomic computing is to create systems that run themselves, capable of high-level functioning while keeping the system's complexity invisible to the user.</p><br>

         <b>➢ Self-Optimizing:</b> An autonomic application/system should be able to detect suboptimal behaviors and optimize itself to improve its execution.<br>
         <b>➢ Self-Healing:</b> An autonomic application/system should be able to detect and recover from potential problems and continue to function smoothly.<br>
         <b>  ➢ Self-Protecting:</b> An autonomic application/system should be capable of detecting and protecting its resources from both internal and external attacks and maintaining overall system security and integrity.<br>
         <b>  ➢ Context-Aware:</b> An autonomic application/system should be aware of its execution environment and be able to react to changes in the environment.<br>
         <b> ➢ Open:</b> An autonomic application/system must function in a heterogeneous world and should be portable across multiple hardware and software architectures. Consequently, it must be built on standard and open protocols and interfaces.<br>

         <b>Computer vision</b> tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.</p><br>

        The origins of computer vision go back to an MIT undergraduate summer project in 1966. It was believed at the time that computer vision could be solved in one summer, but we now have a 50-year old scientific field that is still far from being solved.
Early experiments in computer vision took place in the 1950s, using some of the first neural networks to detect the edges of an object and to sort simple objects into categories like circles and squares. In the 1970s, the first commercial use of computer vision interpreted typed or handwritten text using optical character recognition. This advancement was used to interpret written text for the blind. As the internet matured in the 1990s, making large sets of images available online for analysis, facial recognition programs flourished. These growing data sets helped make it possible for machines to identify specific people in photos and videos.<br>
