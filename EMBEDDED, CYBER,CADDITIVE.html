            It is a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.</p><br>

          Well, much like with any utility -a business benefits from economy of scale, which means cheap computing power. Because a cloud provider’s hardware and software are shared, there’s no need for the initial costly capital investment. And it goes much further than that. Businesses save on the electricity required 24/7 to power and cool that computing infrastructure. In effect, energy costs are shared.
It gets better. Cloud providers have vast resources of computing power at their fingertips. They can allocate these whenever required with just a few mouse clicks. Cloud providers source on a global scale, so they can deliver the precise bandwidth, storage and power business needs when it needs it.
The cloud allows you and multiple users to access your data from any location. Smartphone, laptop, desktop, wherever you are, you can access the data you need at any time.
With cloud computing a business processes its data more efficiently, increasing productivity. Maintenance is much cheaper, often free, so reliability is rarely a worry. Cloud computing allows CEOs to focus on running their business.<br>

          It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. The field is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of Things. Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.</p><br>

          Are<b> “3D printing” and “additive manufacturing”</b>  (AM) the same thing? In general, we know that terms stretch over time to include more than just their default meanings. Whatever the name, new ways of fabricating directly from bytes to stuff are radically changing the what, where, how, and when of making objects.</p><br>
