          It is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use".<br>

          At its simplest, biotechnology is technology based on biology - biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.</p><br>

        When <b>Edward Jenner</b> invented vaccines and when Alexander Fleming discovered antibiotics, they were harnessing the power of biotechnology. And, of course, modern civilization would hardly be imaginable without the fermentation processes that gave us beer, wine, and cheese. When he coined the term in 1919, the agriculturalist Karl Ereky described ‘biotechnology’ as “all lines of work by which products are produced from raw materials with the aid of living things.” In modern biotechnology, researchers modify DNA and proteins to shape the capabilities of living cells, plants, and animals into something useful for humans. Biotechnologists do this by sequencing or reading, the DNA found in nature, and then manipulating it in a test tube – or, more recently, inside of living cells.<br>

       <b> ➢ Agriculture (Green Biotechnology):</b> Biotechnology had contributed a lot to modify the genes of the organism known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops, Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc.<br>
       <b>➢ Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology):</b>  This helps in the formation of genetically modified insulin known as humulin. This helps in the treatment of a large number of diabetes patients. It has also given rise to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene therapy is a technique to remove the genetic defect in an embryo or child. This technique involves the transfer of a normal gene that works over the non-functional gene.<br>
        <b>➢ Aquaculture Fisheries: </b> It helps in improving the quality and quantity of fishes. Through biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed via gonadotropin-releasing hormone.<br>
          <b>➢ Environment (Environmental biotechnology):</b>  is used in waste treatment and pollution prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based disposal. Every organism ingests nutrients to live and produces by-products as a result. Different organisms need different types of nutrients. Some bacteria thrive on the chemical components of waste products. Environmental engineers use bioremediation, the broadest application of environmental biotechnology, in two basic ways. They introduce nutrients to stimulate the activity of bacteria already present in the soil at a waste site or add new bacteria to the soil. The bacteria digest the waste at the site and turn it into harmless byproducts. After the bacteria consume the waste materials, they die off or return to their normal population levels in the environment.<br>

         <b>Blockchain technology-</b> Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity.</p><br>

      <div class="card-body">
        The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <b>Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta</b>. They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party. The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network. In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.<br>

<b>A. The sharing economy ➢</b> With companies like Uber and Airbnb flourishing, the sharing economy is already a proven success. Currently, however, users who want to hail a ride-sharing service have to rely on an intermediary like Uber. By enabling peer-to-peer payments, the blockchain opens the door to direct interaction between parties a truly decentralized sharing economy results. <br><b>B. Crowdfunding ➢</b> Crowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are doing the advance work for the emerging peer-to-peer economy. The popularity of these sites suggests people want to have a direct say in product development.<br>  <b> C. Governance ➢ </b>By making the results fully transparent and publicly accessible, distributed database technology could bring full transparency to elections or any other kind of poll taking. Ethereum-based smart contracts help to automate the process. <br>  <b>D. Supply chain auditing ➢</b> Consumers increasingly want to know that the ethical claims companies make about their products are real. Distributed ledgers provide an easy way to certify that the backstories of the things we buy are genuine. Transparency comes with blockchain-based timestamping of a date and location — on ethical diamonds, for instance — that corresponds to a product number. <br>
<b>E. File storage ➢ </b>Decentralizing file storage on the internet brings clear benefits. Distributing data throughout the network protects files from getting hacked or lost. <br>
