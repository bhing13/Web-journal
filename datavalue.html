        <p><h5> <b> Data Acquisition</b></h5> </p> 
        <div class="def_ai">
        <p>  It is the process of gathering, filtering, and cleaning data before it is put in a data warehouse or any
          other storage solution on which data analysis can be carried out. Data acquisition is one of the
          major big data challenges in terms of infrastructure requirements. The infrastructure required to
          support the acquisition of big data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and
          in executing queries; be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed
          environment; and support flexible and dynamic data structures.  </p><br>

            <p><h5> <b> Data Analysis</b></h5> </p> 
        <p> It is concerned with making the raw data acquired amenable to use in decision-making as well as
          domain-specific usage. Data analysis involves exploring, transforming, and modeling data with
          the goal of highlighting relevant data, synthesizing and extracting useful hidden information with
          high potential from a business point of view. Related areas include data mining, business
          intelligence, and machine learning.</p><br>

            <p><h5> <b> Data Curation</b></h5> </p> 
        <p> It is the active management of data over its life cycle to ensure it meets the necessary data quality
          requirements for its effective usage. Data curation processes can be categorized into different
          activities such as content creation, selection, classification, transformation, validation, and
          preservation. Data curation is performed by expert curators that are responsible for improving the
          accessibility and quality of data. Data curators (also known as scientific curators or data
          annotators) hold the responsibility of ensuring that data are trustworthy, discoverable, accessible,
          reusable and fit their purpose. A key trend for the duration of big data utilizes community and
          crowdsourcing approaches. </p><br>

          <p><h5> <b> Data Storage</b></h5> </p> 
          <p>  It is the persistence and management of data in a scalable way that satisfies the needs of
            applications that require fast access to the data. Relational Database Management Systems
            (RDBMS) have been the main, and almost unique, a solution to the storage paradigm for nearly
            40 years. However, the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties that
            guarantee database transactions lack flexibility with regard to schema changes and the
            performance and fault tolerance when data volumes and complexity grow, making them unsuitable
            28
            for big data scenarios. NoSQL technologies have been designed with the scalability goal in mind
            and present a wide range of solutions based on alternative data models.  </p><br>

            <p><h5> <b>  Data Usage</b></h5> </p> 
            <p> It covers the data-driven business activities that need access to data, its analysis, and the tools
              needed to integrate the data analysis within the business activity. Data usage in business decisionmaking can enhance competitiveness through the reduction of costs, increased added value, or any
              other parameter that can be measured against existing performance criteria. </p><br>
