    <h3>IoT − Advantages</h3>
    <div class="def_ai">  
    <p> 
        <b>Improved Customer Engagement</b> − Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.<br>
        <b>Technology Optimization </b>− The same technologies and data which improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.<br>
        <b>Reduced Waste</b> − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.<br>
        <b> Enhanced Data Collection </b>− Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything. <br>
     <h3> IoT – Disadvantages</h3>
       Here is a list of some of the disadvantages of IoT. these are:
• As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.<br>
• If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.<br>
• Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.<br>
• Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</p><br>
