<li><b> High Accuracy with fewer errors: </b>AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.</li><br>
<li><b> High-Speed:</b> AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, because of that AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.</li><br>
<li><b> High reliability:</b> AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action multiple times with high accuracy.</li><br>
<li>Useful for risky areas:</b> AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a bomb, exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be risky.</li><br>
<li><b> Digital Assistant:</b> AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show the products as per customer requirements.</li><br>

    <p>
      <div class="def_ai">  
<ul> 
<li><b>High Cost:</b> The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</li><br>
<li><b> Can't think out of the box:</b>  Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.</li><br>
<li><b> No feelings and emotions:</b>  AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with humans, and may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.</li><br>
<li><b><Increase dependence on machines:</b>  With the increment of technology, people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.</li><br>
<li> <b>No Original Creativity:</b>  As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.</li><br>
